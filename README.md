Civilization has been to slow to react to climate change, and has been forced to move underwater and rebuild civilization, less go extinct. The player takes the part of a pioneer of this new underwater civilization, collecting resources and helping to build accomdations for the still increasing human population. Food is scarse, tentions are high, and what's more+ADs- the pioneers have some competition. Some humans have mysteriously evolved to better suit the aquatic environment, and have found the pioneers to be less than accepting of their mutated gills, fins, and claws.
